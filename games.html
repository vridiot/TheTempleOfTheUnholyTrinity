<p>Letterwheel letters (test)</p>
<p>Three stone tablets will be presented to the visitor. Each stone tablet is round with 5 letters on them. One in the middle. Four around going clock-wise. The following array shows all letters to show on those letterwheels. One (random) letter must not be shown though. This is the letter that the visitor has to guess.</p>
